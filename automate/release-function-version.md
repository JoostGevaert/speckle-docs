# Releasing a new Function Version

New versions of a Function will be created automatically when a new GitHub release is created.

For detailed instructions on how to create a new GitHub release, please refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). We recommend using the [Semver naming convention](https://semver.org/) for your release names.

Releasing a new version of your Function code causes a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to run. This can be viewed in the Actions tab along the top of your GitHub repository. If there are any errors in the release process, they will be displayed here.

If you require any assistance with understanding errors, please search Speckle's community forum at [speckle.community](https://speckle.community).
