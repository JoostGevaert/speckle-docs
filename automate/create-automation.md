# Creating Automations

## What is an Automation?

Automations allow you to achieve a wide variety of tasks. Automations are what applies a Function to a [Speckle Model](../user/concepts.md). Automations are used to configure a Function to suit your particular requirements.

For example, there may be a Function which can render a photograph-quality image of any given model. An Automation would allow you to specify the camera position, lighting, and other settings to achieve the desired result, and then command the Function to render an image of your particular Speckle Model.
