# Object Tooltips

When an object is selected in the Power BI viewer, a tooltip showing the object's properties and values will be displayed.

The information displayed will be extracted from theÂ **Tooltip Data**Â input. You should be able to add as many as necessary.

The tooltip's position will be updated as the camera moves through the model.

These tooltip values are not bound to Speckle data, meaning you can merge other data sources into your query and display "non-speckle data" in your Speckle object's tooltips.
